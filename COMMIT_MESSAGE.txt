Initial commit: Portfolio website

Built a clean portfolio site with PHP and MySQL. Dark theme, responsive design, works on mobile.

Main features:
- Projects and skills from database
- Contact form that saves to MySQL
- Simple admin panel to check messages
- Responsive layout with Bootstrap
- Security stuff (prepared statements, .htaccess protection)

Added proper .gitignore so credentials don't get committed. Included example config files for easy setup.

Ready to use - just clone, add your database credentials, and go.
